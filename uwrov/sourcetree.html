            SourceTree is a GUI created for Git. It was developed by Atlassian, as if anyone cares about
            that. Note that the terms 'Git' and 'SourceTree' are used somewhat interchangeably in this
            article. Technically, Git is the underlying version control system that provides all the
            functionality and SourceTree is the GUI that we are using to access it, but for the purposes
            here they are the same thing.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div>
            Sometimes menu item names or other things change to reflect the names of something. In these
            cases, I will denote the variable things with &lt;angle brackets&gt;, so a possible menu item
            might be described as 'Delete &lt;branch&gt;'. In the program, for the 'master' branch, the
            actual menu item would then read 'Delete master'. Simple.
        </div>

        <br>

        <h3>Install</h3>

        <div>
            SourceTree can be downloaded from <a href="http://sourcetreeapp.com">sourcetreeapp.com</a>.
            Then, open the .dmg and drag the application do you Applications folder. After that, should
            you be feeling so adventurous, you may open the app.
        </div>

        <div>
            <br>
        </div>

        <h3>Use</h3>

        <h4>General Notes</h4>

        <div>
            Whenever you make changes to a file, you may have to refresh SourceTree so it sees the
            changes if you get impatient waiting for it to update. You can either go to "View &gt;
            Refresh", or, if you want to get really fancy,&nbsp;<span style=
            "font-family: Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.600000381469727px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 224);">âŒ˜R</span>.
            Also, if the instructions say to do something such as create a branch, and there's a popup
            with a bunch of options, leave everything not specified as default if you're confused. Just
            keep clicking 'Next' or 'Create' or whatever the blue button says.
        </div>

        <h4>Opening Repositories</h4>

        <div>
            If you have a repo that's already set up for git on your computer, you can open it in
            SourceTree by going to "File &gt; Open..." and selecting the appropriate folder. If not,
            you'll probably want to clone a repo from somewhere. In that case, go to "File &gt; New /
            Clone". The Source Path is the remote URL, which should be listed somewhere on wherever
            it's hosted and and in .git (on Assembla, it's next to the repo name on any of the Git
            tools). Set the Destination Path to wherever you want your local copy of the repo to be
            stored. You can also bookmark repositories by going to "File &gt; Bookmark Open
            Repositories..." so they show up on the home screen when you start the app.
        </div>

        <h4>Pulling from Remote</h4>

        <div>
            In the general case, it's best to pull any changes from the remote repo before working to
            make sure you have the latest updates. To do this, simply click the "Pull" button (the
            solid down arrow) from the top menu bar. Pulling gets the latest changes from the remote
            and automatically merges. Alternatively, you can get the latest updates <i>without</i>
            merging them by Fetching (dashed down arrow). You will then have to merge them into later
            to see the changes.
        </div>

        <div>
            Hopefully when pulling updates, there will be no problem and the merge will happen cleanly.
            If this happens, then you are done. However, if there have been changes to the remote and
            your local repos, then there may be conflicts. See&nbsp;'Resolving Merge Conflicts' under
            the&nbsp;Troubleshooting section for help.
        </div>

        <h4>Pushing to Remote</h4>

        <div>
            When you want to upload your changes so that everyone can see them and stand in awe of
            their glory, you want to push to your remote. To do this, make sure you have committed all
            the changes you want to show (you can also make changes to your local copy and not commit
            them, and they won't be pushed). If no one's pushed anything of their own since you last
            pulled, then the push should go smoothly. If not, and you get the error:
        </div>
        <pre>
            error: failed to push some refs to '&lt;your remote&gt;'
        </pre>

        <div>
            then you have to pull the most recent code, merge it if necessary, and re-push. See
            'Resolving Merge Conflicts' under the Troubleshooting section for help.
        </div>

        <h4>Branching</h4>

        <div>
            Git is designed to make branching easy and painless, unlike certain other systems (I'm sure
            SVN has its own merits, such as the fact that everyone uses it. Hey, it's like Windows!).
            Branching usually occurs when you want to work on a feature or side project without
            disrupting the main line of development. Think of branches as separate lines of development
            that are then merged back into the master branch when completed. You can see what branches
            you have in the left bar, under 'Branches'. To switch to editing a specific branch, right
            click on it and select 'Checkout &lt;branch name&gt;' or just double click.
        </div>

        <div>
            In SourceTree, create a new branch by clicking on the Branch button on the top menu bar.
            The Current Branch is the branch you are branching off of, and New Branch is the name of
            your new branch. Once you create the branch, you will notice that the new branch and the
            original are located at the same commit. If you start editing them however, you'll see
            where they diverge.
        </div>

        <h4>Merging</h4>

        <div>
            Merging is the opposite of branching. It's what you do to integrate branches back into each
            other (such as when you're done implementing a feature). It is also done to integrate
            changes in the remote. This section will focus in merging branches locally.
        </div>

        <div>
            First, to merge two branches, checkout the branch you want to merge <i>into</i>. This
            branch will reflect the changes of both branches while the other won't change. Then, right
            click on the branch you want to merge (from the left bar) and choose 'Merge &lt;this
            branch&gt; into &lt;branch to merge into&gt;'. If there are merge conflicts, see 'Resolving
            Merge Conflicts' under the Troubleshooting section for help. Once that is done, you'll see
            the branches coming together in the Log view. You can also delete the old branches if you
            want by right clicking on them in the left bar and choosing 'Delete &lt;branch&gt;'.
        </div>

        <h4>Tagging</h4>

        <div>
            Tags can be used to flag specific commits for later use. This essentially means that you
            can keep track of different versions of your work easily. Tagging a commit is easy: just
            click the tag button in the top menu bar. You can either tag the commit that your branch
            points to (the default), or you can go tag a specific commit. Tags will also be added to
            the remote so everyone else can see and use them.
        </div>

        <div>
            <br>
        </div>

        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

        <h4>Resolving Merge Conflicts</h4>

        <div>
            If you try to merge branches or pull from remote, there may be merge conflicts awaiting
            you. These are just places where two (or more) people modified the code/documents in ways
            that Git can't automatically merge. As such, it is up to you to go in and manually solve
            the problem.
        </div>

        <div>
            Usually (always?) when there are unresolved conflicts,&nbsp;SourceTree will show an
            'Uncommitted changes' entry in the log view that shows the conflicted file(s). You can fix
            these conflicts in the file itself, or by going to "Actions &gt; Resolve Conflicts &gt;
            Launch External Merge Tool". The merge tool is a basic tool that allows you to compare
            changes side by side and for each change choose how you want to handle it (see below for
            more). Note that you have to quit the merge tool application for the changes to take
            effect, and even if you do not change anything, you have to save it. However, for finer
            control over how the merge occurs, Git provides some helpful info in the file. Where the
            conflicts occur in the file, there should be something that looks like:
        </div>
        <pre>
            &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
            This is stuff I did
            =======
            Someone else wrote where I wanted to
            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; master
        </pre>

        <div>
            The top part is changes you have made, and the bottom is what was originally there that
            conflicted with your additions (or deletions). Just change the file to what you want it to
            look like, then commit it as usual. SourceTree may also create a &lt;file&gt;.orig that has
            lists the conflicts, but unless these are important to you (and you can also see all these
            changes through SourceTree, admittedly with some effort) you can probably discard it.
        </div>If you're working on a Mac with Xcode, you'll be able to use the FileMerge merge/diff
        editor by default. However, you may want to download the P4Merge editor from Perforce as it
        gives you more control over how the merge is made as well as an easy way to see changes. You
        can download it at&nbsp;<a href=
        "http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/20-User#10">www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/20-User#10</a>.
        Note that you only have to move p4merge to your Applications folder, not the other files there.
        Then, in SourceTree, under "SourceTree &gt; Preferences... &gt; Diff", you be able to change
        the "Visual Diff Tool" and "Merge Tool" to p4merge. When you want to merge files or just see
        the differences, they'll be open in p4.

        <h4>Errors when Pulling</h4>

        <div>
            If you get the following error:
        </div>
        <pre>
            error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
        </pre>

        <div>
            then you have uncommitted changes when trying to pull. Git doesn't want to delete these
            changes, so it throws an error. If you don't care about the changes, then click the Reset
            button. It will bring up a dialog so you can see what changes you've made, and you can
            discard them from there.
        </div>

        <div>
            More likely though, you'll want to commit your changes and merge them with the updates.
            Commit changes as usual, then pull again. If it executes successfully, then you are done.
            If it pops up saying that there are merge conflicts, then you have to resolve those
            yourself. See the 'Resolving Merge Conflicts' section for help with this.
